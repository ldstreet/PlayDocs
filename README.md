# PlayDocs
PlayDocs is command line tool for converting Swift Playgrounds to Markdown and HTML. Playgrounds have supported rendering markdown from the beginning, so why not leverage that for generating documentation that can live both in your repository as executable code and on your wiki or blog as documention or a post?

## Usage

You can use PlayDocs both as a commandline tool or as a framework in your own code.

### Commandline Tool
Here is the basic command for generating a readme via a Playground:
```
playdocs generate ./MyPlayground.playground
```

And if you want it to output as html:
```
playdocs generate ./MyPlayground.playground --html
```

To open the generated file immediately have creation:
```
playdocs generate ./MyPlayground.playground --html --open
```

To specify a destination:
```
playdocs generate ./MyPlayground.playground --destination /path/to/file/MyFile.md --open
```

### Package
To make your conversions in swift, you can use `PlayDocsKit`

``` swift

// Convert swift source from a string to a markdown string
public func convertToMarkdown(text: String) -> String

// Convert swift source from a file to a markdown file
public func convertToMarkdown(from source: URL, to destination: URL) throws

// Convert swift source from a string to a html string
public func convertToHTML(text: String) throws -> String

// Convert swift source from a file to a html file
public func convertToHTML(from source: URL, to destination: URL) throws
```

## Install

To install the commandline tool:
```
git clone https://github.com/ldstreet/PlayDocs.git
cd PlayDocs
make install
```

To use PlayDocsKit add the following to your `Package.swift` file.
```swift
// üèì A framework for converting Playgrounds and Swift files to markdown and html
.package(url: "https://github.com/ldstreet/PlayDocs.git", .branch("master")),
